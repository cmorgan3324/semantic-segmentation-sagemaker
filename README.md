# Semantic Segmentation Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a complete pipeline for semantic segmentation using deep learning. The notebook covers dataset preparation, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Features
- Preprocessing and loading a dataset for semantic segmentation
- Training a deep learning model using a segmentation architecture (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabV3, etc.)
- Evaluating the model performance using appropriate metrics
- Visualizing segmentation results on test images
- Saving and loading trained models for inference

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- GPU support recommended for faster training (NVIDIA CUDA-compatible)

## Dataset Preparation
- The notebook expects an image dataset structured into `train`, `validation`, and `test` splits.
- Each split should have corresponding images and labeled masks for supervised learning.
- If a custom dataset is used, ensure masks are properly annotated with distinct pixel values for each class.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Install required dependencies (see below).
3. Prepare the dataset following the structure mentioned above.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions to execute each section.

## Running the Notebook
To run the notebook, execute the following command in your terminal:
```bash
jupyter notebook Semantic_Segmentation_Notebook.ipynb
```
Follow the cell execution order as described in the notebook.

## Dependencies Imported in the Notebook
The following libraries are required and are used in the notebook:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `opencv-python`
- `scikit-learn`
- `albumentations` (for data augmentation)

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Results
- The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to measure segmentation accuracy.
- Results include visual overlays comparing ground truth masks with predictions.
- Performance metrics such as IoU (Intersection over Union) and pixel-wise accuracy are calculated.
- The model's predictions are displayed in the notebook with sample segmentation outputs.
